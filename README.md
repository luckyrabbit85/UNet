# Pytorch Implementation of [U-Net](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1505.04597v1.pdf)

This repository contains an implementation of the UNet architecture in PyTorch. UNet is a fully convolutional neural network that is widely used in computer vision tasks such as image segmentation, semantic segmentation, and medical image analysis. The architecture was originally proposed in the paper "U-Net: Convolutional Networks for Biomedical Image Segmentation" by Olaf Ronneberger, Philipp Fischer, and Thomas Brox.

The UNet architecture is built using an encoder-decoder structure. The encoder portion consists of a series of convolutional and pooling layers that reduce the spatial resolution of the input image while increasing the number of features. The decoder portion consists of a series of up-sampling and convolutional layers that restore the spatial resolution of the output while reducing the number of features. The output from the encoder is concatenated with the output from the decoder, allowing the network to learn rich, multi-scale features for accurate segmentation.

## Acknowledgments
We would like to acknowledge the authors of the original UNet paper, Olaf Ronneberger, Philipp Fischer, and Thomas Brox, for their pioneering work in the field of image segmentation.

We would also like to acknowledge the PyTorch community for their continued contributions to the development of the deep learning framework.
